# AI-System-that-discounts-perishable-food-based-on-its-expiry-date
Food waste is increasing enormously. This food waste also includes perishable food which is wasted due to the
lack of sale of that particular product because of its expiration date. If a customer has to choose either the
product which has 10 days of expiration date left or the same product with 2 days of expiration date, they tend
to choose the one with the more expiration days left i.e. the product with 10 days of expiration left. This
problem can be fixed by using an Artificial Intelligence system, which predicts the expiration or the shelf life of
a particular product and discount the price of that product with respect to its expiration date.

In this research we studied the use of Artificial Intelligence which includes machine learning, rule-based system
to save perishable food from getting wasted because of its shelf-life. AI provides means to tackle the most
pressing environmental challenges. Use of discounting can play a vital role. Perishable products are bought by
customers based on its expiration date. The Artificial Intelligence system which predicts shelf life as well as
discounts the products based on its shelf life or expiration date will help to reduce the food waste caused by
expired perishable products. The financial loss faced by companies due to unsold perishable products can be
reduced with the help of this system. Adding more categories of perishable food products to this system can
have positive impact on customers pockets, profit of food companies and environment. This system can be
installed in grocery stores and other markets to save food and increase sales on large scale.
